In the project, it has been considered a conductor and participants. The conductor
creates a survey and relays some amount of balance from his account. Furthermore, the conductor
decides the amount of prize for that survey. The balance of the survey is shared according to
the prize tha determined by the conductor (i.e., (Balance of the survey)/(Prize of the survey) =
Amount of participants that are expected to fill the survey). In addition, to prevent bot attacks
captcha has been added. Each participant must have done the captcha stage to reach the survey
questions. After filling the survey, participants earn the prize that the conductor determined. 
In addition, a donation feature has been added for participants to send a donation to the conductor.
